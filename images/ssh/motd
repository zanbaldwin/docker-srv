Welcome
=======

* This environment is only to access files and setup websites. It is NOT the
  environment that the website will actually run in.
* The webroot is "/srv/public", it will look for "index.php" then "index.html".
* If MySQL is enabled, it will be available on host "mysql" not "localhost".

* This environment is completely isolated and could disappear and/or get reset
  at any time (when the system decides to install updates, change ports, etc).
  When this happens, anything outside the "/srv" directory will be LOST.
   - The entire filesystem is volatile storage.
   - The "/srv" directory is the ONLY directory mounted to permanent storage.
* "REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED" warnings are also common (and
  expected) whenever an environment gets reset. You can ignore this warning.

* The package manager is APK, use it to install any software you need (curl,
  nano, git and mysql-client are installed by default):
   - apk add [package-name]
